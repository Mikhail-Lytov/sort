## The simplest sorting ##
****Task :** implement three sorting algorithms: bubble,
inserts, selection.
## Instructions for implementation: ## 

- the laboratory work consists of two files:
  ***simple-sort.java*** — function prototypes, function implementation;
  ***test-simple-sort.java*** — testing functions;
- list of function requirements (it is enough to implement three):
1) sorting an array of integers of a given size
2) sorting any subsequence of the array
3) sorting arrays with any data types
4) sorting the container by choice
